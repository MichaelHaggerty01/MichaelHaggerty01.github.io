## Code Review:
*While I did have other artifacts planned, I ultimately changed due to them being unfeasable.*

*However, This can still show my skill at analyzing code.*

### Narratives _Originally Written 05/24/23_
For my software engineering artifact, I chose “Fuzzy Farmer 3D”, which was made for my “GAM-303” class at SNHU.  This program is a game where the player must climb rocks and dig blocks to collect all the “fuzzies” within a time limit.  The game opens with an instruction screen overlay on the first and only playable level.  If the player collects both red fuzzies and both blue fuzzies, then they win and are taken to a victory screen.  If the time expires, the player is instead taken to a “game over” screen.  I chose Fuzzy Farmer 3D because it has an intricate counting system where the player needs to collect all fuzzies of every type before beating the level.  Said system also works together with a level system to make sure that I originally planned to use the “Coinbased Castle” program from “GAM-305”, but I could not get it working.  While that program was part of a team project, Fuzzy Farmer 3D was created solo (with the help of instructions given during my GAM-303 class).  I also made good use of quick asset swapping in my enhancements that demonstrate a unique way to dig tiles.
Past iterations of this game have had flaws where the player could jump out of bounds, so I replaced the fence with a brick wall that still fits the aesthetic of the game.  I also made certain geometry in the level “crumble” when interacted with by having the object delete itself and be traded with a nearly identical physics object. I also fixed several UI issues.  The first was that the Intro screen was not big enough.  I also added a background behind the timer and fuzzy counts so that players can see the HUD better. For the text and other objects to be centered on the HUD and win/lose screens, it is recommended to play the game as a standalone application.  When playing, the player can also press escape to close the game without having to tab out.
I set out to create a more solid program.  I am most proud of the new destruction system.  Having digging claws that splinter objects is far more realistic than having the objects that just vanish without a trace.  This is one of the “well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value.”  In this case, as with most games, more advanced game mechanics means more desire for the product, which leads to more sales.
When developing the program, I had a lot of trouble implementing the “dig” feature.  I first had to install a new plugin for “apex destruction.”  Next, I repeatedly tried to get the digging feature to work with a single object, but the object would either start destroyed, would not get destroyed, or would have no collision.  I could not find a good fence texture big enough to properly, so I settled on a brick wall that still fits the farm aesthetic.  I learned more than I ever needed to about fracture/destruction physics in Unreal.  I also learned that swapping objects can have many other uses for future projects.
